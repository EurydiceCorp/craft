2. Unit testing
3. Integration testing
4. Security scanning
5. Performance testing
6. Deployment to staging/production

### Pipeline Configuration

The main workflow file (`.github/workflows/main.yml`) includes:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build
        run: |
          echo "Building the application..."
          # Build commands here
      - name: Test
        run: |
          echo "Running tests..."
          # Test commands here
      - name: Deploy
        if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: |
          echo "Deploying to production..."
          # Deployment commands here
